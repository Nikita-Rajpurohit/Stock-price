Stock Price Prediction

Predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to the volatile nature of financial markets. This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts stock price movements by analyzing historical data. The model provides a signal indicating whether buying a particular stock is advisable.

Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that analyzes historical stock data to forecast future price movements. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model aims to assist investors in making informed decisions.
