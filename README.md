Predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to the volatile nature of financial markets. This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts stock price movements by analyzing historical data. The model provides a signal indicating whether buying a particular stock is advisable.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of historical stock prices, including features such as:
Date
Open price
High price
Low price
Close price
Volume
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset files.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with data analysis and model development.
models/: Saved machine learning models.
